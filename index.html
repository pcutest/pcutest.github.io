            <li><img src="style/images/asset/bullet-1.png" alt="" /> How much they are REALLY are paying in fees</li>

            <li><img src="style/images/asset/bullet-3.png" alt="" /> How their underlying funds rank against their peers </li>
          </ul>
          <p>This service will be entirely free!  After seeing the results of their CheckUp, the client will be directed to take immediate action by being connected to an independent (fiduciary) advisor in their local area or have their investments managed by a 3rd party low cost technology solution.</p>

          <p>Portfolio CheckUp is building a network of independent (fiduciary) advisors who are committed to transparency and the removal or disclosure of any conflicts.  In order to provide this free value-add service for investors, there will be a reasonable revenue share with the advisor.

          <p>I am thrilled to be asked to be associated with Portfolio CheckUp, a revolutionary free tool for investors.    The goal is for investors to see how much they are really paying in fees and how excessive fees are destroying their hopes for financial security.  The tool also shows how their portfolio has performed over time as compared to other approaches (as we know that the vast majority of funds underperform).</p>
          <p>This service will be entirely free to the investor and if they want to take immediate action, they will be connected to an independent fiduciary advisor in their local area.    I view this is a powerful public service that will let investors truly “take their broker for a test drive” and see the value of a fiduciary vs a broker.  One final note, I will NOT be receiving any economic benefit for this initiative.  I am not looking to profit from main street investors.  I want to effect change at the highest level in this country and help investors create financial freedom. </p>
