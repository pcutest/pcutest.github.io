          <p>Portfolio CheckUp is building a network of independent (fiduciary) advisors who are committed to transparency and the removal or disclosure of any conflicts.  In order to provide this free value-add service for investors, there will be a reasonable revenue share with the advisor.

          <p>I am thrilled to be an advocate and proponent of Portfolio CheckUp, a revolutionary free tool for investors.   After interviewing 50 of the world’s top financial minds, and realizing just how badly individual investors are often treated, it was clear that there was a dire need for "transparency for all."   We brought together a world class technology team to build a powerful system that, within minutes ,will allow investors to see how much they are really paying in fees, how much risk they are taking, and how their existing portfolio has performed over time as compared to other approaches.</p>
          <p>This service will be entirely free to the investor and if they want to take immediate action, they will be connected to an independent fiduciary advisor in their local area. I view this is a powerful public service that will let investors truly “take their broker for a test drive” and see the value of a fiduciary vs a broker. One final note, I will NOT be receiving any economic benefit for this initiative.  Although I was offered a percentage of the firm, I asked that this portion be directed to my <a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/our-response/about-us/partners/current-promotions/100-million-meals-challenge.html" target="_blank">100 Million Meal challenge</a> and that all profits be delivered to Feeding America, the nations #1 hunger relief organization.</p>
